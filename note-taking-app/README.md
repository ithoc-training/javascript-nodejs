# Instructions for Running the Application

## Setup
- Ensure Node.js is installed.
- Create a new folder and place the app.js file inside it.

## Running Commands
- Use the terminal or command prompt to navigate to the folder containing app.js.
- Run the application with different commands:
  - To add a note: ```node app.js add "Note Title" "Note Body"```
  - To read a note: ```node app.js read "Note Title"```

## Examples
```shell
node app.js add "Moon" "The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average distance of 384400 km (238900 mi), about 30 times the planet's diameter. The Moon always presents the same side to Earth, because gravitational pull has locked its rotation to the planet. This results in the lunar day of 29.5 days matching the lunar month. The Moon's gravitational pull – and to a lesser extent the Sun's – are the main drivers of the tides."
```
```shell
node app.js add "Sun" "The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive, hot ball of plasma, inflated and heated by energy produced by nuclear fusion reactions at its core. Part of this internal energy is emitted from its surface as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, providing most of the energy for life on Earth."
